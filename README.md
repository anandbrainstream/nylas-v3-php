## ‚ö°Ô∏èUsage

To use this SDK, you must first [get a free Nylas account](https://dashboard-v3.nylas.com/register).

Then, follow the Quickstart guide to [set up your first app and get your API keys](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/v3/getting-started/quickstart/).

### üöÄ Making Your First Request

You use the `NylasClient` object to make requests to the Nylas API. The SDK is organized into different resources, each of which has methods to make requests to the API. Each resource is available through the `NylasClient` object configured with your API key.

For example, first configure client object like below:

```php
use Nylas\Client;

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$options = [
    'api_key'   => 'NYLAS_API_KEY',
    'client_id' => 'NYLAS_CLIENT_ID',
    'region'    => 'NYLAS_REGION', // optional - Default "us"
];

$nylasClient = new Client($options);
```
Then use it for make consecutive api requests.

## Administrative Api info.

Application api could be like:

```php
try {
    $applications = $nylasClient->Administration->Application->list();
    print_r($applications);
} catch (GuzzleException) {}
